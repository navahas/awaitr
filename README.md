# Awaitr

Inspired by ClaudeCode animated loader, decided to create a dummy implementation as a fun exercise.

- Word animation with character highlighting
- Multiple spinner styles
- Color-coded loading states (Rustifying, Compiling, Borrowchecking, Working)
- FPMS-controlled animation

```bash
cargo run
```
